# Compiler
Compiler written in Jai. Gonna build a simple thing first, then try to make it
good over time.

### Stuff I found helpful
- LLVM
  - Godbolt with x86-64 clang, `-g0 -O1`, and IR viewer (shows LLVM IR in text form)
  - Online LLVM resources haven't been helpful so far for more abstract concepts.
    Once you have a concrete problem or want to know what functions to call, the docs
    might help, but in general the resources online have not been helpful so far.
    Godbolt is usually much faster and more reliable.
