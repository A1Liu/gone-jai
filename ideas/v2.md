# Ideas

Simple language, with simple user-facing semantics.

Compiler is exposed as library, and can by imported in the build script to accomplish much more complex stuffs.

# Include in base language
- Primitives, pointers, slices
- Functions
- Control flow
- Type id's, runtime type information
- Dynamic memory
- Macros/Iterators
- Scope begin/end directives, scoped feature enable/disable
- Compile-time constants
- Structs, Anonymous structs
- C ABI
- Simple enums
- Basic type inference
- Function pointers
- Allocators
- Implicit context

# IDK Yet
- Generics
- Closures
- Complex enums
- Non-nullable types
- Overloading
- Operator overloading
- Interfaces/traits/etc.
- Contracts/type requirements
- Compile-time constant evaluation
- Tuples

# Too Complex, use compiler API
- Metaprogramming
- Inheritance
- Garbage collection
- Python ABI
